            The primary use for this interface is to allow application code to abort build process.<para />
            It is possible to build page layout model for only a few pages at start of the document then abort process and render only what has been built already.<para />
            Note, however, that rendering results may not match what would be rendered for each page if process would have finished.<para />
            This technique may not work for every document or may fail completely.<para /></remarks>
